# Slim3 Boilerplate

This slim3 boilerplate is made for everyone who would like to kickstart quickly a web project.
`PHP ^7.0` required :)
It is composed of many great packages such as:

  - Bootstrap 3 (should be updated to version 4 soon)
  - Eloquent
  - Phinx
  - Monolog
  - JQuery
  - leafo/scssphp
  - matthiasmullie/minify

### Assets management

Simply use `composer run-script compile-assets` and this should convert your `scss` files and minify them as well as `js` files from `/assets` directory (no binary dependencies required).

### Note
Feel free to open issues, ask question or make some pull requests ! I'm maintaining this on my spare time so give me some time to get back to you :)

Enjoy !
